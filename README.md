## How to use

### Crawler

1. Open GetData.ipynb

2. Change the arguments when init Crawler (creating a new instance of the crawler):

```python
crawler = DataCrawler(newest = 0, keyword = 'thoi trang nam', categoryids = '15139')
```

_newest_: the first item will be got (start with 0)

_keyword_: keyword

_categoryids_: in this specific case (shopee), some keywords have specifics category, you can go to shopee, search with your keyword, choose the category, and look on the URL bar:

It will show something like this:

<https://shopee.vn/search?facet=2829&keyword=thoi%20trang%20nam&noCorrection=true&page=0>

The value of param `facet` (2829) is the `categoryids` you need.

_Notice that in this project we don't support call multi categoryids._

3. Change file name:

```python
crawler.saveFile("ShoppeItem_thoiTrangNam_aoKhoacAoVest.tsv")
```
